# Bank-Account


This is an implementation of a Bank Teller Terminal System. With the use of Linked List, this program dynamically allocates and manages a database of customers read through a .txt file.
When a user enters their ID and PW the program scans through finding their account, displaying their balance and prompting the user to deposit or withdraw, then performs requested action and logs
the user out.
